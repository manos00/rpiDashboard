# rpiDashboard
Scripts I created for a dashboard-like screen rendered on an e-paper display.

## Requirements
### Hardware

## Zero W
### Step 1
The Pi Zero W fetches data from the following APIs:
- [Tankerk√∂nig API](https://creativecommons.tankerkoenig.de/) (used for getting gas prices)
- [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/guides/overview) (syncing my google calendar events)
- [Weatherapi](https://www.weatherapi.com/)

In addintion it also formats the current date and time.
### Step 2
Most of the data is stored in a plain text file called `formattedData.txt`.
The gas prices are stored in a database, which is then used to draw a graph with time on the x and price on the y-axis.
### Step 3
The graph is exported as an image and converted to a bytearray. The script used for that is [`img_to_bytearray.py`](ZeroW/image_conversion/img_to_bytearray.py). 
It requires image-magick to be installed on the system for it to work.
### Step 4
Lastly the data is wirelessly sent to the Pi Pico W.

## Nano W
### Step 1 (only on boot)
The Pi Nano W connects to the local Wi-Fi.
### Step 2 (every minute)
Upon recieving the data from the Pi Zero W, the Pico generates an output for the e-Paper display and displays the dashboard-screen.
